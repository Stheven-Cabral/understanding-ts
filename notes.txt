Core Types
(number): All numbers, no differentiation between integers and floats, i.e. 1, 5.3, -10
(string): 'Hi', `Hi`, "Hi"
(boolean): true or false
(object) : {kay: value}

Type Inference
(type inference) - Typscript is able to infer the type of a constant or variable (let or var) based on the value.
  - For example const num = 5; will have a type of '5' because it is constant.
  - For example let num = 5; will have a type of 'number' because it is a variable.
